# Real-Time Bitcoin Dashboard - Data Engineering Project

This repo contains the final project for the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) course by DataTalksClub.

## Introduction

Bitcoin as digital currency is notoriously volatile. This project aims to provide a real-time dashboard of the bitcoin rate in USD, coupled with a moving average and rolling high statistics for a better intuition into currency's trends.

## Dataset

This project uses data from [coinapi.io](https://coinapi.io) REST API to acquire real-time rates for bitcoin.

Each API response contain data about the timestamp, currency, and rate (value).



## Tools

The following tools were used to make the project:

* Containerization: Docker

* Workflow Orchestration: Kestra

* Realtime Data Streaming: Apache Kafka

* Database: Postgresql

* Data Transformation: DBT

* Data Visualization: Metabase
